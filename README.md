## Background

| Technology   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Game Theory  | A consensus mechanism used to ensure that every block is admitted by peer nodes through a smart contract for storage purposes. Validators are rewarded with native tokens for transaction validation.                                                                 |
| Cryptography | Each data in the block is encrypted using a cryptographic hashing function, ensuring the security of network information. The first block is called the Genesis Block, and blocks are chained together by connecting the previous block's hash value.           |
| P2P Network  | Each full node in the network stores and maintains transaction information to avoid dependency on other nodes.                                                                                                                                              |

|                     | Efficiency | Consensus Determination | Immutability | Read Permission | Tampering Difficulty |
|---------------------|------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Consortium Blockchain | Partial    | High                   | High         | Permissioned    | Might Be Tampered   |
| Private Blockchain    | Yes        | High                   | High         | Permissioned    | Might Be Tampered   |
| Public Blockchain     | No         | Low                    | Low          | Permissionless  | Very Difficult To Tamper |

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data protection             | If the data owner and source peer are the same, no third-party is needed as the source directly protects the data.                                                                                                                               |
| Decentralized ledger technology | The core functionality of blockchain used to register transaction details. It is common for all types of users, whether public or private.                                                                                                    |
| Blockchain as a data structure | Similar to a data structure, blockchain can store diverse data such as medical, insurance, user identity, etc.                                                                                                                                  |
| Double spending             | By combining distributed ledger and consensus protocol technologies, the blockchain system tackles the issue of double spending in existing systems.                                                                                            |
| Better user anonymity       | Ensures the secrecy and privacy of users, providing better anonymity compared to conventional systems.                                                                                                                                          |
| Immutability                | Information stored in the blockchain cannot be altered without compromising miners. Any attempt to change data can be easily traced and detected.                                                                                              |
