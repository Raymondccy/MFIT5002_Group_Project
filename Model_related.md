Performance Metrics of Blockchain
For the evaluation process, the presence of a system is required in spite of their type as either public or private. Further, we have also given you the other experimental result analysis metrics for comparative study.

Foremost comparison parameters

Block Size
Throughput
Block Time
Maximum Amount of Gas
Number of Peer Nodes
Number of Blocks for Mining
Total Number of Nodes
Number of Transactions / Records
Development Platform of Blockchain
Last but not least, our developers have listed the top 3 worldwide famous blockchain benchmarks which is the framework to the developed blockchain system through pre-defined models and get the test outcome.
